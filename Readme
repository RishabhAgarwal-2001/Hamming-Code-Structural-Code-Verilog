This is the Verilog code for (16, 5) Hamming code. 
src folder contains all the required files.
encoder is an independent module.
decoder and decoder_ham works together as a single module to decoder.
test_bech is the simulation source which encodes a message then introduces a single bit error in the message. This error is introduced in practical scenario due to noise in nature.
The transmitted message is then passed into decoder which correctly removes the error.
